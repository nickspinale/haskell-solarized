# haskell-solarized

The solarized color scheme in haskell values, for use in packages such as `xmonad` or `yi`, whose configuration is actually just plain old Haskell.

Perhaps someday there will be a universal api for configuration options like colorshemes, to make configurations more portable.
Until then, I plan on using this little module.
